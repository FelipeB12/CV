            <h2> Ubicate </h2>
            <p class="original">
                There have been two big issues all the time at the time of buying in developing countries, there is so many small stores that families owns, they only open their place and wait people to go and buy. First, those small places have not place to compete against large companies with big platforms and advertisements online, losing selling power; secondly, people many times do not go to those large companies because are expensive and not as close the corner store that have cheaper options, but many times they have to walk more and go to many of this small stores to find what the needed.
            </p>
            <span class="dots">...</span>
            <p class="extra">
                That’s why I developed Ubicate, a business built out of a web - platform developed in 2020, with the main goal of giving an opportunity to these small stores that cannot have a web site due to the economical and time cost. It was developed under a directory idea, where customers can check its information and find the places´ addresses, opening times and cost of the products. It was a solution for small stores to sell special products and customers to find the best place to make their purchase. 
                <br><br>
                It was highly developed on PHP in a strong back-end to be able to have different admin users to control user’s information and be able to supervise the politics of the company and give support to the registered users. An admin zero to control security information as back-ups so the information is always safe, and get informs on real time of the products and customers, the platform was automatized enough to be able to send automatic email to restart your password, and let you long in under specific requirements. All this back end works next to my data base in MySQL, where all the information was safe and updated from the platform. Furthermore, it was developed with help or different frame works like bootstrap to assure the final costumer never had issues checking information from any device. 
                <br><br>
                It was a challenge to build such a big project alone, unfortunately there is not easy to find people to work on an idea that rewards your work after months, this was not a reason for me to not try it and make my best, I had to learn how to register my company legally, how to manage social media and advertisements such as Facebook ads, meaning that I had to learn how to write for internet and make attractive posts. It was necessary as well to go out to the street and visit those small stores to offer them my solution. Unfortunately, that was something I could not do by myself while I was studying, and hiring someone did not work.

                This is an environmental project that is developed mainly and primarily in Cundinamarca, more specifically in the municipalities of Mosquera, Funza, and Madrid as preparation for intervention in the largest and most polluting cities in Colombia, and with a vision to reach all the cities of Latin American countries. In this way, this document will show all relevant aspects regarding administration, processes, and development of the project, as well as the way in which the three main problems that have been decided to be addressed will be attacked: the environment, the national economy, and employment for people who need it most in view of all the environmental problems that irresponsible purchase and use of polluting materials causes every day, in addition to the ignorance when disposing of their waste.

                <strong>• Mission:</strong>
                <br>
                We are a group of people who represent the environmental initiative "Yocuidomiciudad" (I take care of my city), with the same objective of helping people in economic difficulties to provide them with their rights and achieve comforts, all hand in hand with environmental care. Becoming a reliable source that promotes a better with the environment, improving conditions of the environment and quality of life of the people involved.
                <br><br>
                <strong> How to solve these problems:</strong>
                <br><br>
                In the previous point, we talked about the inefficiency regarding the responsible use of waste in Colombia (17%), while developed countries like the Netherlands manage to use 95% of their garbage. Data that must be seen as an opportunity, inspiration, and demonstration of the process to follow.
                <br><br>
                <strong>  • Pollution:</strong>
                <br>
                o On land:
                <br>
                We mentioned the amount of grams, kilos, and tons that we produce daily and annually, a problem that will be fought with the collection of these wastes to give them a correct treatment after their original use.
                <br>
                Considering areas such as parks, sidewalks, and streets, along with other public spaces that are contaminated, we have decided to collect garbage in these places to give a correct treatment to these wastes. In this way, we will avoid the destruction of public places, and show the environmental change that most people will follow, as recycling points will be enabled in public places, making the task of recycling and keeping our city clean easier.
                <br><br>
                o In water:
                <br>
                This is a problem that will be solved from two specific points: 1) The implementation of ecological points on the street for the collection of objects that are usually not taken into account, such as cigarette butts, straws, spoons, flyer tags, or lids, small objects that go unnoticed and will eventually end up either in the outlets of our sewer system contaminating the water, or even affecting the evacuation of water by clogging the drains. 2) The training of people for awareness to avoid sending food scraps, oils, and small objects correctly that can cause the same problems: clogging the drainage ways of the houses and water contamination due to where these substances end up.
                <br><br>
                o Landfill incapacity:
                <br>
                Knowing the current conditions in which landfills will end and the collateral damages they accuse such as diseases. There is only one way to deal with this problem: Our solution focuses on recycling, reducing the production of garbage that may not end up in the dumps, through education and encouraging a culture of rejection of the purchase and use of disposable items through advertising campaigns either on social networks or campaigns in public places. A solution focused on reducing the amount of waste in homes, industries, offices, and any other place where waste that can be recycled is produced.
                <br><br>
                o Ignorance:
                <br>
                Ignorance is a solvable problem that represents the biggest environmental damages, since people do not know how or how much their actions affect the environment. Actions that we mentioned earlier such as: Littering, not recycling, letting food go down the drain, or throwing garbage into rivers and seas.
                <br>
                Problem that we solve by sharing valuable information such as tips as training, teaching in the most effective way (social networks) how people should handle their waste.
                <br><br>
                o National economy:
                <br>
                Currently, we suffer an economic crisis that increases the number of affected people either by unemployment or the lack of growth of small and medium-sized companies. Aspects that belong to the economy of our country.
                <br><br>
                o Unemployment:
                <br>
                Due to the poor management of waste and little recycling in the country (19%), hundreds of people will need to be hired in different areas, both digital and accounting and recycling processing where our main focus is to hire in poverty and informal workers, to support them and ensure their social benefits in addition to benefits such as ensuring rest days and family activities.
                <br><br>
                o Lack of incentives for pro-environmental companies:
                <br>
                Due to the lack of companies that work hand in hand with the environment, many activities are not developed promoting the participation of these types of corporations, so our solution is to mix environmental care with social networks, events, and entities that have an impact on the environment. Making the work of getting involved in environmental care more and more economically attractive.
